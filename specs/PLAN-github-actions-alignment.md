# GitHub Actions Alignment Implementation Plan

Status: Approved

## Specification

- `specs/SPEC-github-actions-alignment.md`

## Affected Files

- `.github/dependabot.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/publish-forgejo.yml` (renamed)
- `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
- `README.md`
- `tests/test_github_workflows.py`
- `specs/SPEC-github-actions-alignment.md`
- `specs/PLAN-github-actions-alignment.md`

## Implementation Performed

1. Renamed the publication workflow to the shared filename.
2. Standardized workflow names, concurrency, immutable pins, checkout handling,
   pip caching, step names, and formatting.
3. Updated focused workflow assertions and README guidance.
4. Added grouped weekly Dependabot updates.
5. Added this completed-work spec and plan.

## Validation Run

- YAML parsing and shared structural assertions.
- `python3 -m unittest tests.test_github_workflows`: 12 passed.
- `git diff --check`.

## Validation Skipped

- Full tests, hosted Actions, and live Forgejo publication/download were skipped
  because they exceed the `super-agent` validation boundary or require external
  runtime state.

## Review And QA

- Formal QA and independent review were skipped as required by `super-agent`.

## Documentation

- README and completed-work artifacts document the delivered conventions.

## Delivery State

- All accepted files are staged after final reconciliation, committed together,
  and pushed to `origin/main` as explicitly requested.
- No linked worktree or artifact cleanup applies.

## Residual Risk

- Hosted execution and live Forgejo behavior remain unverified.
